## Production 7

For this production, I went back to one of my all-time favourite and significant video games to connect to, Battlefield 1. This game was one of the few video games that truly shaped my perspective on history and my understanding of learning. On the surface, it seems like just another shooter game, but it's much more, especially to me. Battlefield 1 set me on course and is the reason behind why I am so passionate about history and why it is now my teachable subject. The game, both through its story and online modes, especially with the Italian Fronts and the “Arditi” soldiers, is deeply personal to me and my history as well. To situate this in Jim Gee’s text, he would call games like this one, “World Games”, a simulation that allows players to live and learn from a complex system (Gee, 2003/7, p. 2).

In class, our group focused on Gee’s ideology of “distributed intelligence via the creation of smart tools”, which also fits Battlefield 1 perfectly. As I played the game, I again saw how it constantly spreads knowledge to it and its strength to connect the player to the world of the First World War. Like Gee argues,”Good video games distribute intelligence between a real-world person and artificially intelligent virtual characters”, and as I replay Battlefield 1, this is true (Gee, 2003/7, p. 4). When I play as an “Ardito” soldier, the game system's (maps, squadmates and tactical prompts, the sound, everything) works to simulate military cooperation. The player is surrounded by knowledge and is allowed to connect with other humans to experience teamwork and understand the scope of WWI.

What stands out the most  about Battlefield 1 is language and learning in context. Gee explains that “video games are simulations of experience” that “put language into the context of dialogue, experience, images, and actions” (Gee, 2003/7, p. 7). The game does not teach you the language of war through lists found in a textbook, but rather by immersing you (the player) into the battlefield itself. As you play, you hear yelling of all languages, hearing phrases like “no man’s land” or “Fiamme Nere”, and seeing scenes of tanks rolling through trenches and machine gun fire. All things I would learn in Grade 10 History, I learned from when I first played this in Grade 8 in 2016, and it stuck with me as I experienced these "historical terms" firsthand. Battlefield 1’s situated meaning allows learning through doing, emotions, and play.

The design of Battlefield 1 also aligns with the principles of being “pleasantly frustrating” and “the role of failure” in video games (Gee, 2003/7). Every mission created by the game is created so you DIE (as shown in the video at the bottom), exposing players to how Generals saw soldiers as replaceable and that war is death and that there was no mission where death did not follow. This cycle of death and being reborn as a new soldier mimics the cycle of trial and error, another theory we talked about in class. All these quirks and details of Battlefield 1 come together to allow players to understand and be situated in historical problem-solving from adapting tactics, learning maps and using available resources to be successful on the battlefield.

Another significant experience from Battlefield 1 is incidental learning. When I first launched this game back in 2016, I was not eagerly playing to learn dates, names, or battles, yet I quickly found myself sucked into the history of the game. I began researching battles and battalions found in the game. Also talking with my father about the Italian troops, learning about how my Great-Great Grandfather had fought alongside the Arditi at Caporetto and Monte Grappa (the same troops and battles depicted with the Game and story mode). The game sparked something inside me; it changed my perspective on history and made me feel connected to it for the first time. This is stealth learning at its best, as my curiosity and perhaps the curiosity of others peaked as loaded into a game for “fun”.

Overall, Battlefield 1 is not just a “good game” or an "epistemic game”; it is an important piece of media and is a teacher. It is significant, and I believe authentically (with research done in another class (over 10-page essay)), puts players on the Frontline of history. It is the pinnacle of Gee’s vision of video games that learning should feel embodied, situated, social, and connected to identity. Playing as Italian Soldiers brought me not only to understand history but also to connect and feel it, something that is extremely rare and hard to find inside a lecture hall or classroom.
