## Production 5 - On the Way to Video Inquiry

In class, we started by using ideation decks to begin learning about the theories, techniques, themes, and editing of filmmaking. This was exciting and fun, and I am keeping this with me as I move forward working on Production 5. For Production 5: *On the Way to Video Inquiry*, I decided to use iMovie, a program I had some familiarity with before today, but had not used or explored for quite some time. Returning to it was challenging but familiar, but I stayed strong as I wanted to deepen my understanding of its editing tools and reimagine it for how such software could be used in historical education in the classroom. To test this, I created a short but heavily edited sideshow-style documentary titled “The History of the Land We Live On”. As the text states, “documentary DV promotes empowered practices of critical media literacy essential for navigating an increasingly digital yet culturally divided world” (Doerr-Stevens, p. 61). This experiment reveals how iMovie’s potential to make progress and allow for digital storytelling can make history more engaging, accessible, and multimodal for classes and students.

As I explored the tools of iMovie, from their text and titles options to transitions and templates. As seen above, the options were endless and diverse, allowing me to overlay text, images, and/or videos, which helps display historical facts, names, and dates. Transitions such as “fade to black” and “swipe” were effective in creating a sense of time passing, fitting perfectly with the theme of history. I also learned new editing terminology, such as “Ken Burns effect” and “timeline scrubbing”, describing how editors move, zoom, adjust, and visualize time and space within a video. These features made me realize how editing is its own form of media, where the meaning of a video can be completely changed as it is designed by pace, sound, and sequence.

I did not work too much with voice; I still tried working a bit with sounds, more specifically music. I did slightly test out how to record voiceover directly into the software and played around with the volume levels using the audio mixer. However, I focused more on iMovie’s “fade in” and “fade out” between different sounds and songs, which would help with smooth transitions between narration and background music. I first forgot how to do this, but a quick google search and I remembered everything I needed to know, from fading to how to even change the pitch of the music. I also realized how important it was to record in a quiet space with minimal background noise and maintain a consistent voice level and distance from the microphone. This ability to control sound made me think about how multimodal texts communicate beyond words.

Next, I tested some special effects and filters to help understand how a visual tone contributes to storytelling . The colour palette tool gave me the liberty to control the colour and feel of the video and photos by making filters like “black & white” and “aged films” to create an archival feel, reinforcing the historical theme of my short project. The somewhat pre-edited clips and images I used helped me with this process. However, while I started to notice the possibilities iMovie had, I also saw the limits. It had freedom to control colour and saturate; however restricted users' creativity to built-in transitions. The “system rules” make some parts of editing easier for beginners and some easier for veteran editors, without much tutorial provided by the software, it challenges beginners and relearners to find their own way.

Finally, throughout the editing process, I learned more and more, but also avoided coming face-to-face with many production challenges. I did not have to worry about lighting as I used images and sounds professionally produced and pre-edited. Still, I did play around with the *aesthetics* and colour grain of these videos I used and left in my more that raspy (sick) voice. However, in future filming, specifically these upcoming weeks in class, my group and I would need to pay close attention to these aspects of editing and maybe even incorporate some of these flaws into our final video production. I took this opportunity to watch some videos, including this amazing tutorial by Jordan Morrison (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z6hwAJ-3mCE), to be prepared and be able to contribute to editing when the time comes.

To conclude, this production reveals how one can “combine various modes of expression (visuals, sound, narrative, etc.) into a single digital media text with focus and purpose” (Doerr-Stevens, 56). Playing around with iMovie again after so many years was not only a great technical refresher but also helped me learn new techniques as I connected to my groups and the Professor’s ideation decks. Overall, iMovie, even with its limits and lack of guidance, worked great for me (a beginner) and can be a great tool for students to critically assemble, create, and represent the past using multimedia.
