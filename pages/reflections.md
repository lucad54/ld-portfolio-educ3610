## Reflection 1 - Deploying My Website

This week's activity of starting up a website brought back some memories from a previous History course I took during my undergraduate. After reading the instructions and seeing the options for website builders, I began planning out what I was going to do and I turned to what I used before, Github. I quickly realized that working with GitHub again was going to be much more challenging than using a simpler drag-and-drop platform like Wix. Even though I have used Github in the past, enough time had passed that I also knew I had forgotten many of the basics.

As I began to develop my website, I quickly encountered a number of problems. From random small errors to bigger problems like my webpage “not-exsiting” (as seen in the picture above). At first, this created a sense of frustration, especially when I couldn’t remember simple commands or how to find and fix problems in my repository. However, instead of giving up, I remembered that I had held onto an old worksheet from my earlier history course where I had first learned GitHub. After I, luckily, found the instructions and gave them a quick read through it all started to come back to me. 

I began shifting from frustration to satisfaction, yet these “problems” reminded me that struggling is an important part of the learning process for everyone. However, once I got past those hurdles, I restarted appreciating the challenge and freedom GitHub offers. During the process, the repository itself gave me “feedback”. Through trial and error I was able to find and fix incorrect coding, allowing me to learn from my mistakes independently. GitHub’s *freedom* supported my learning, as it forced me to take steps back and think on how I was to solve and understand my own webpage.

Finally, this experience felt very similar to a classroom. It especially reminded me of the first day of grade 10 high school math after not having done any math since the previous year’s first semester. It was also similar because I was pushed to look at course material to re-learn and guide me, something I have not had to do in a long time. Overall, my experience of frustration did end up being rewarding, with my persistence to “power up” my new website on GitHub reminding me that learning never ends.
