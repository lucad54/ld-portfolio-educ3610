## Production 9 - Twine

For this production, I was not just analyzing a game; I was building one. Designing and creating my game, *KILLED IN ACTION*, was an amazing experience and really pushed me to understand and use James Paul Gee’s learning principles. It made me think about how my choices in the creative process would invoke learning, emotion and consequence while thinking about how I could be the most historically accurate to make a “good game” (Gee, 2003/7). Even before I read the production I knew I wanted to create a game related to my teachable, histoy. So in the end I followed "prompt 2" from the production website and based my game around the historical events of the First World War. It lets players choose between five very different identities (an American Harlem Hellfighter, a Prussian conscript, an Italian Ardito, a French medic, or a British child soldier), making one of the most prominent principle in my game *identity*. Gee argues that a *good game* is one that allows players to experience and take on new identities to shape the learning. That is exactly what I wanted and what I did. Each identity offers a different story, different choices and different learning for the play, shaping how they learn about the war.

I also focused on how I could use Gee’s principles of well-ordered problems and pleasant frustration. So, every choice takes players deeper into the chaos and uncertainty of the Western or Italian Front, but nothing is random. The “right” choice is not always obvious, and most choices, even ones that seem best for survival, end in what many experienced during war: death. This will build frustration in players, the kind that Gee claims will continue to encourage learning, unlike something straightforward and boring (Gee, 2003/7). Another principle I built into my game is situated meaning. As students are not just repetitively reading about history in a traditional textbook, but rather are experiencing the history through their decisions in a game. As Gee puts it, language and knowledge make sense when tied to “dialogue, experience, images, and actions” (Gee, 2003/7). For example, players playing as a Harlem Hellfighter will learn about the racism rampant in the American and many other “western” militaries, or if they play as the British boy, they will learn about child soldiers, though through emotion. 

Finally, I found my game, *KILLED IN ACTION*, to be a great display of systems thinking. The game is a reminder that the war was a complex system, not just one of major super powers fighting for territory or economic growth, but also imperial decisions, structural inequalities and personal stories. My game is a lens into the complex emotions and experiences of the people who lived through war. Creating a game where many paths lead to being *KILLED IN ACTION* is also creating knowledge on one of the most important lessons of history and war: death.

Overall, production 9 was great and exciting. Creating a historical video game with Twine provided me with an opportunity to learn about how I could introduce and utilize multimodal pedagogies in my future classrooms. Using sounds, image and text to create my production also furthered my understanding of Gee and his principles as I set out to create a *good game*.
