## Production 2 - Critical Essay

Indigenous ways of knowing have been and continue to be pushed to the rear of educational and other institutions. Brayboy and Maughan in *Indigenous Knowledges and the Story of the Bean* begin to illustrate to readers the tensions as Indigenous Knowledges challenge western traditional approaches of schooling. These systems are connected more to the human aspects of learning, focusing on relationality, lived practice, and responsibility. The text sheds light on the transformative possibilities of learning, in stark contrast to the shortcomings of western education that we have long been exposed to.

In class the first quote we picked out was on page 1 *“I listen to the teachers as they teach, and it sounds like what happens when you push play and fast-forward on a tape recorder”* (Brayboy & Maughan, 2009, p. 1). This critique stood out to our group because we related to it, the alienation of Western schooling. Lessons are forced, rapid, decontextualized of their meaning and simplified to facts we must memorise rather than learn. This system of knowledge is detached from the lives of the learners and their environments, the complete opposite of Indigenous Knowledge systems. Indigenous ways value understanding that comes through experience, practice and relations. Indigenous processes of community and survival exposes Western education's reduction of knowledge to performance and individualism. Where Descartes states, *“I think, therefore I am”*, Brayboy and Maughan counter, *“We are, therefore I am”* (Brayboy & Maughan, 2009, p. 15). These quotes come together to challenge the status quo of education and insist that knowledge is relational and collective. 

The next area our group focuses on is the story of the bean.The text recounts students frustration when told to plant a bean in sand as part of a science experiment, with one student saying, *“We wouldn’t plant it in sand anyway; things don’t grow well in sand, and everyone knows that”* (Brayboy & Maughan, 2009, p. 14). Our group this quote was important as it relates to how Western pedagogy strips learning from context. We contrasted it to Indigenous ways of knowing, that if one plants the bean it would be done with care and to nurture both the plant and the people it will feed. Connecting it to Ha Ao Hou: A New World, the video shows how Hawaiian educators embed cultural traditions (canoe building, language) into education the same as how Indigenous teachers ground lessons in cultural experiences and land. Isolated and meaningless activities have been damaging education, but Indigenous practices rooted in sustaining life, community and environment challenge us as future teachers to rebuild it. 

To finish, these tensions point to a deeper epistemological divide between Western and Indigenous. A quote that stood out to me was were Brayboy and Maughan use Battiste to explain that *“Knowledge is not a commodity that can be possessed or controlled by educational institutions, but is a living process to be absorbed and understood”* (Brayboy & Maughan, 2009, p. 12). In class, we compared how Westernized education treats knowledge as a *noun*, something one collects, stores or measures, to how Indigenous systems see it as a *verb*, something always changing, alive and tied to experiences. This ideological difference of Indigenous knowledge will be significant in redefining education in our futures and how we will approach learning, not just as memorizing facts, but about learning how and why things matter, and how to live them out. In a world shaped by technology and AI, Indigenous ways of knowing display perspectives that remind us that education should stay rooted in life experiences. The CBC article, *Indigenous virtual reality: An experiment in 'Indigenization of cyberspace'*, shows educators how we can transform digital spaces into territories where stories, languages and traditions are continuously growing. This VR project connects to the story of the bean, as it connects digital learning  with Indigenous values of culture, survival, respect, balance and community. Altogether, reminding us that education is more than just memorization, it is about identity and connection through learning. 

Through past history courses and this reading I have come to recognize that Indigenous ways of knowing should replace many aspects, if not all, of western traditional education. We as educators can redefine and allow education to live using Indigenous values of knowledge as process, context and responsibility. Overall, Brayboy and Maughan’s critique of Western schooling will stick with me through my teaching career as I continue to learn for the rest of my life.
