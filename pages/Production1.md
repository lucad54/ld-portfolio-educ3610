## Production 1 - Refelction on Deploying My Website

This week's activity of starting up a website brought back some memories from a previous History course I took during my undergraduate. After reading the instructions and seeing the options for website builders, I began planning out what I was going to do and I turned to what I used before, Github. I quickly realized that working with GitHub again was going to be much more challenging than using a simpler drag-and-drop platform like Wix. Even though I have used Github in the past, enough time had passed that I also knew I had forgotten many of the basics.

As I began to develop my website, I quickly encountered a number of problems. From random small errors to bigger problems like my webpage “not-exsiting” (as seen in the picture above). At first, this created a sense of frustration, especially when I couldn’t remember simple commands or how to find and fix problems in my repository. However, instead of giving up or turning to *AI*, I remembered that I had held onto an old tutorial worksheet from an undergraduate history course where I had first learned GitHub. After I, luckily, found the instructions and gave them a quick read through it all started to come back to me. 

I began shifting from frustration to satisfaction, yet these “problems” reminded me that struggling is an important part of the learning process for everyone. However, once I got past those hurdles, I restarted appreciating the challenge and freedom GitHub offers. I created a minimalist information based website that will help document my work throughout EDUC 3610 course, with blue undertones to match the main background photo. During the process itself, the repository gave me “feedback”. With this, and through trial and error, I was able to find and fix incorrect coding, allowing me to learn from my mistakes independently. GitHub’s *freedom* supported my learning, as it forced me to take steps back and think on how I was to solve and understand my own webpage.

Finally, this experience felt very similar to a classroom. It especially reminded me of the first day of grade 10 high school math after not having done any math since the previous year’s first semester. It was also similar because I was pushed to look at course material to re-learn and guide me, something I have not had to do in a long time. Overall, my experience of frustration did end up being rewarding, with my persistence to “power up” my new website on GitHub reminding me that learning never ends.
