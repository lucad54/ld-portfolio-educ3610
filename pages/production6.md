### Quick Comment on Ideation decks:

For my first time creating a trailer style film, the professor’s ideation decks help set up what my final video creation looked like. They were basically a creative compass, guiding me and grounding my ideas. My ideation deck helped me move from vague ideas and hopes for a final video to concrete concept plans. As someone whose academic life has been climatized to text-based and information/memorization heavy course work focused on history, this production was refreshing. It allowed me to be creative while following a guideline created by myself, an important shift from traditional research for myself and would be great for use in the classroom for students.

### Comments on Video Creation:

For this production I decided to move away from history narratives and connect to something closer to my culture and hobbies. As my ideation deck shows, I worked on and created a trailer-style video for a local men’s hockey league that I am personally connected to. Hockey has always surrounded me in my life, whether I was playing it, watching my cousins play or even watching the pros on the TV. It's a part of my, and many (if not all) Canadians, identity; as a fan, player and now a men’s league coach with my friends. So, using this as my base for my film allowed for a deep authentic learning as I filmed, edited and completed production. I connected to Doerr-Stevens’ (2017) idea of embodied inquiry, as I placed my body and experiences into the center of the creative process. My filming was not simple and fast, I had to go back through my “archives” of clips and work together with fans in the stands. I wanted diverse perspectives, culture, goals and celebration all packed into my final creation. Following again Doerr-Stevens notes that video composing invites us to “a multi-sensorial process of investigation” that traditional tests and writing assignments cannot capture and I can vouch for (p. 57).

Moving on, the editing process was where I felt my learning grow the most. Although I have used iMovie before, coming back to it almost nine years later, with hopes to dive deeper into the system than before, was a challenge. Still, it exposed me to how layered and expressive digital media and the editing process is for video production. I brought over the play from the previous production and continued to experiment with new types of cuts, transitions and especially with sound layering (very hard). Everything I did, every clip, cut and sound used was planned with my original ideation deck to create an environment similar to being at a live hockey game. Even the songs I selected are culturally connected with hockey; “Lay it on the Line” by Triumph from a 2024/2025 season stanley cup commercial, “Thunderstruck” and “Howlin for You” from a childhood NHL video game “*NHL SLAPSHOT*”. All these tracks were more than filling the ambience of my video, it connected my production to the collective memories of childhood and Canadian Hockey.

As Zseder (2016) argues, this production pedagogy allows us learners to become “producers of meaning” rather than passive consumers. It is creating spaces for “student-produced case studies” that are displaying our personal connections and perspectives. With the help from friends and fans I was able to capture different points of view and I was then able to edit these clips into a video of my “own”. It felt like an act of assembling emotion, voices and energy into something bigger than a “sport”.

Still, there were challenges, lighting varied amongst the locker room, outdoors and even varied among different arenas within the same building. Also, while I had permission to use footage, the players and I agreed to avoid listing names in a sequence as I had planned for a “montage-style” section of my production. I did not let these challenges sway me from what I wanted to create, so I spent time adjusting light for the clips to match a warmer feeling connecting again to Canadian culture and “nostalgia”. And for that section I really wanted to create, I still did. I just listed out each player's number as it still shows the story of the players on the team. As I worked through this I remembered that documentary work is “messy”, a process of constant negotiation between intention, ethics and the material I have (Doerr-Stevens, 2017, p. 56).

To conclude, this production revealed how creativity and research are connected. I worked with iMovie to create a form of critical inquiry with multimodal production, following Doerr-Stevens (2017), “using multimodal resources to create and negotiate alternative viewpoints” (p. 61). Even with my video focused on Hockey and the culture around it, my eyes were opened to how powerful films and videos are as a pedagogical tool for teaching history. As a teacher I can use it to give students a voice to represent themselves and challenge the narratives of education not only through words but through the multimodal opportunities of  film with sound, movement, editing and emotion. To sum, for me this project was not only personal but also significant for my future pedagogy as a teacher; one that is focused on learning as an embodied, cultural and creative act.
